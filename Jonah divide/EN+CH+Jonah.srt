神要我警告他们，他将审判他们，可是凭什么要警告他们？

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,600
So they repent, say they are sorry, and then receive God's mercy？
说声对不起，然后得到神的怜悯？

So you ran away from God？

46
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,400
Technically speaking, hiding from the all knowing deity is statistically impossible.

Here he is, below deck!

或者神顾念我们，使我们不致灭亡。

来吧，我们掣签，看看这灾临到我们是因谁的缘故。

They must be trying to see of Jonah cause the storm!  
他们想看看，是不是约拿招来了暴风雨。

我是希伯来人，我敬畏耶和华，那创造沧海和地，的天上的神。

You see, it is his fault! 
看到了吗，都是他的错！

他之前说过，他在躲避他的神。

What should we do to you to stop this storm?

Throw me into the sea, and it will become calm again.  
你们将我抬起来，抛在海中，海就平静了

Look out, the mast is coming down!

我侦侧到我们以下有一头庞大的动物正在靠近。

我以为鱼只有外面才黏糊糊的呢，真让人受不了。

Disaster follows me at every turn, I will not live through this. 
灾难就一直追着我，简直活不下去了。

74
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,000
Jonah, I think if God wanted you dead, you would be dead. 
神要你死，你肯定早死了。 

75
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,250
I almost think he wants to save you.

76
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,850
Next time, he should just send some life preservers. 
下次他最好先送些救生设备来。

神让你往东去，可你却偏偏往西走

从阴间的深处呼求，你就俯听我的声音。

我心在我里面发昏的时候，我就想念耶和华。

and my earnest prayer went out to you in your holy temple. 
我的祷告进入你的圣殿，达到你的面前。

那信奉虚无之神的人，离弃怜爱他们的主。

89
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:23,200
But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my vows.  
 但我必用感谢的声音献祭与你。我所许的愿，我必偿还。

90
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,000
My salvation comes from the lord alone. 
救恩出于耶和华。 

91
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,900
Amazing, full terrestrial expectoration.

92
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,700
You mean, we just got barfed up. 
你的意思是，我们刚被吐出来。

Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach to it the message that I tell you. 
你起来，往尼尼微大城去，向其中的居民宣告我所吩咐你的话。

Move on, you lazy beast!

How do you even talk to these people, Jonah?

People of Nineveh!
 尼尼微的人呐！

耶和华我的神派我来宣布他对尼尼微的审判，因为他已经看到你们的罪恶。

我想上帝给约拿的使命不是为了交朋友

Jonah says these people are his enemies, but they're people, too. 
约拿说，这些人是他的仇敌，可是他们也同样是人呢

哦，听着，尼尼微人，你们的日子快到头了。

尼尼微将被属天的力量摧毁，这力量无比强大，这里的居民从未见过。

00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,480
Not in all the enemies of Syria has ever fought combined. 
他比你们所有的敌人加起来的力量还要强大

107
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,300
Jonah. If God has shown you so much mercy, yes, saving you from that storm. 
神已经怜悯原谅了你。是啊。他就你脱离了暴风雨。

108
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,800
And then getting you out of the belly of that giant fish, 
 然后又让你从大鱼的肚子里出来

109
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,000
why wouldn't he show the same kind of mercy to the Nineveh's, I mean, 
那他为什么就不能同样怜悯原谅尼尼微人呢？

If they're willing to change. 
如果他们愿意改变的话。

111
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,000

你们别再说了 这些人就是不配得到神的赦免和怜悯

112
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,500
 Even if we ask for it with all our hearts?

我们坐在灰中，畏罪哀痛，都是为了寻求赦免。

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:32,140
People and animals alike must wear garments of mourning, and everyone must pray earnestly to God.  
人与牲畜都当披上麻布，人要恳切求告神。

122
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,680
They must turn from their evil ways and stop all their violence.
 各人回头离开所行的恶道，丢弃手中的强暴。

123
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,550
Who can tell? Perhaps even yet god will change his mind and hold back his fierce anger from destroying us? 
或者神转意后悔，不发烈怒，使我们不致灭亡，也未可知。

124
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:02,300
Jonah sure seems upset about something.  
约拿好像还在为什么生气哦。 

125
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,300
Well, it's been forty days and everyone is repented. 
 已经40天了，所有人都归改了。

126
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:10,200
Didn't I say before I left home that you would do this, lord, that is why I ran away to Tarshish?
耶和华阿，我在本国的时候，岂不是这样说吗。所以我急速逃往他施去。

127
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:17,500
I knew that you were a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. 
我知道你是有恩典，有怜悯的神，不轻易发怒，有丰盛的慈爱，

128
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,300
You are eager to turn back from destroying people. Oh, I'd rather be dead than alive. 
并且后悔不降所说的灾，耶和华阿，现在求你取我的命吧。因为我死了比活着还好。

I have done what the Lord asked of me. 
 我已经按照神所吩咐的做了。

130
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,100
And he gives me this plant to shade my head and provides me comfort. 
他给了我这颗蓖麻遮荫， 我知道他是来安慰我。

131
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,890
But then he shows the same mercy to all the sinners of Nineveh. 
可他也同样怜悯尼尼微城的那些罪人们。

132
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,600
Where is the justice in that? 
这哪里是公义的呢？ 

133
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,700
 I always thought that when someone does something wrong, they should be punished,   
我从前总认为如果别人做了错事，就该受到惩罚。

134
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,500
but when I do the wrong thing, I'm pretty glad that God forgives, 
可是当我自己犯了罪，就因神仍饶恕罪人而欢喜。

135
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,600
but you and I live better lives than those people. 
可是你我比那些人强多了啊！

136
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
So much for shade. I'll look for some more cover.
 荫凉一下子就没有了，我去找找别的地方

137
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,900
Is it too much to save one little plant lord? The only thing that gave me comfort.  
主啊，就这么一颗蓖麻活下来很难吗，这是唯一能安慰我的东西啊

138
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,590
Is it right for you to be angry about a plant? 
你因这棵蓖麻发怒合乎理吗？

139
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,140
You have had pity on the plant for which you have not labored, nor made it grow. 
这蓖麻不是你栽种的，也不是你培养的。 

140
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:32,270
 It came up in a night and perished in a night. 
一夜发生，一夜乾死，你尚且爱惜。

141
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,160
And should I not pity Nineveh. 
何况这尼尼微大城

142
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:47,200
That great city in which are more than 120 thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left. 
其中不能分辨左手右手的有十二万多人

143
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,700
If I accept mercy from God.

144
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,600
I have to be willing to give it to others,  
那我也应该去原谅别人

145
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,400
even Sharon Myers.  
甚至是沙罗梅尔？ 

146
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,390
Excuse me, guys, I think I have an appointment to keep. 
抱歉，伙伴们，我要遵守一个约定。 

147
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,260
So we wondered if you'd heard anything about a stolen bike. 
你听说了么，有人丢了一辆自行车

148
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,900
Oh, you want my help. Whoever took it may have just made a mistake.  
嗯。你们想让我帮忙吗？ 不管是谁拿的，都可能是弄错了。

149
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,800
They still have time to do the right thing. 
但他们仍然有改正的机会

150
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,280
I-I took it, I don't know why I did it. It was stupid and

I'm sorry. 
对不起

152

 if you can help us return the bike to its rightful. 
 可我需要你帮忙把自行车还给他的主人

154
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,020
I guess I can do that. 
没问题

155
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,140
God led a whole city off the hook, I think I can give Shalom Meir a second chance. 
连整座城的人神都能赦免，我想我也可以再给沙伦梅尔一次机会。

156
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Time to go home. I'll walk this time, I've got some thinking to deal, 
该回家了，这次我要走着回去，我要思考些事

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,500
I am done with it! I am walking with Joy! 
够了！我要和Joy一起走！

Walking is good! I like walking, walking is good, I do it all the time. 
我喜欢走路。走路挺好。

160
00:22:48,800 --> 00:23:00,300
Jesus you died upon the cross
And rose again to save the lost

161
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:15,800
Forgive me now of all my sin
Come be my savior, Lord and friend

162
00:23:15,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Change my life and make it new
And help me Lord to live for you
